            title: "Why do you need this soap - Activated Charcoal Facial Soap Bar - Essential Oil Soap - Natural Soap",
            description: "This Activated Charcoal handmade soap is my best selling soap and here&#39;s why - my charcoal soap contains activated charcoal in addition to a combination of essential oils wonderful for any skin type, not drying just soothing. Makes a wonderful facial soap and a great all over body bar. This listing is for one bar of soap, each bar weighs between 4.8 - 5.5 ounces. Ingredients: coconut oil, organic sustainable palm oil, olive oil, organic shea butter, castor oil, sodium hydroxide(lye), distilled water, activated charcoal, essential oils TESTIMONIALS ***************************** Highly recommend!! I first came across it in this store, and it&#39;s fantastic!!! Thank you Melissa!!! &quot;I use this soap on my face and it is awesome. It smells great. I feel like I&#39;m at a spa when I use it. It lathers well and my face feels really clean when I rinse it off. This soap is perfect. I use it all over. It moisturizes even better than the sea salt soaps. This soap is amazing! I&#39;ve never used anything like it. And customer service/shipping was great. L-O-V-E this soap! It smells great. Very generous size that should last me quite a while. Thanks so much - I&#39;ll definitely be back for more! This formula is just awesome. I have a very sensitive irritated mixed combination skin but I do NOT have any problems at all using this soap!!! Thanks This is my 5th purchase from Melissa in the last year and my first time trying out a few different soaps. I really like the activated charcoal, it has a nice, clean, smell and dries out my skin in a good way. Three Kings smells like cinnamon and spice and everything nice. The other bars that I ordered (rosemary and lavender mixes) smell very herbal, a bit overwhelmingly so. That&#39;s probably fine if you like herbs and aromatherapy. I do have to say, Melissa makes the BEST lip balms. (Peppermint ice and lavender mint = amazing) I have been using her lip balms exclusively for the last year and they last forever. :) This soap is fantastic. It smells refreshing and invigorating, and it feels positively wonderful on your skin. I&#39;m so happy I purchased this. It will definitely become a staple in my soap collection. Wow... what a wonderful experience.... ordering more I love this product so far! **********************************",
