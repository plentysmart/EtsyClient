            title: "Why do you need this soap - Activated Charcoal Facial Soap Bar - Essential Oil Soap - Natural Soap",
            description: "This Activated Charcoal handmade soap is my best selling soap and here&#39;s why - my charcoal soap contains activated charcoal in addition to a combination of essential oils wonderful for any skin type, not drying just soothing. Makes a wonderful facial soap and a great all over body bar. This listing is for one bar of soap, each bar weighs between 4.8 - 5.5 ounces. Ingredients: coconut oil, organic sustainable palm oil, olive oil, organic shea butter, castor oil, sodium hydroxide(lye), distilled water, activated charcoal, essential oils TESTIMONIALS ***************************** Highly recommend!! I first came across it in this store, and it&#39;s fantastic!!! Thank you Melissa!!! &quot;I use this soap on my face and it is awesome. It smells great. I feel like I&#39;m at a spa when I use it. It lathers well and my face feels really clean when I rinse it off. This soap is perfect. I use it all over. It moisturizes even better than the sea salt soaps. This soap is amazing! I&#39;ve never used anything like it. And customer service/shipping was great. L-O-V-E this soap! It smells great. Very generous size that should last me quite a while. Thanks so much - I&#39;ll definitely be back for more! This formula is just awesome. I have a very sensitive irritated mixed combination skin but I do NOT have any problems at all using this soap!!! Thanks This is my 5th purchase from Melissa in the last year and my first time trying out a few different soaps. I really like the activated charcoal, it has a nice, clean, smell and dries out my skin in a good way. Three Kings smells like cinnamon and spice and everything nice. The other bars that I ordered (rosemary and lavender mixes) smell very herbal, a bit overwhelmingly so. That&#39;s probably fine if you like herbs and aromatherapy. I do have to say, Melissa makes the BEST lip balms. (Peppermint ice and lavender mint = amazing) I have been using her lip balms exclusively for the last year and they last forever. :) This soap is fantastic. It smells refreshing and invigorating, and it feels positively wonderful on your skin. I&#39;m so happy I purchased this. It will definitely become a staple in my soap collection. Wow... what a wonderful experience.... ordering more I love this product so far! **********************************",

                policy_welcome: "Thanks for taking the time to visit my shop of luxury bath and body creations just for you. I pride myself on creating unique natural bath and body products that you can&#39;t find anywhere else. Please enjoy your visit and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Citrus oils such as Bergamot, Grapefruit, Lime, Lemon, Neroli, Orange and Petitgrain can be photosensitive and should not be worn before going in the sun. If you have questions about my products, please feel free to ask. I try to keep them as natural as possible, but that also means they will have a shorter shelf life. The following is general information that applies to all of my products: If you are pregnant there are certain oils I recommend you avoid, such as Cedarwood Cypress anise (star) bay laurel birch black pepper cassia cedarwood (all types) cinnamon (leaf) citronella clary sage clove fennel (sweet) . I try to make sure this is listed in my listings, but it doesn&#39;t hurt repeating. This is not an exhaustive list, but only includes the essential oils I use. ",
                policy_payment: "I accept Paypal and money orders. Please contact me if you would like to make other payment arrangements.",
                policy_shipping: "The shipping rates we assign to items are as exact as possible. We do our best to reimburse shipping fees overpaid by $2 or more when we ship your order. If we underestimate your shipping, we absorb the difference. We&#39;ve done our best to calibrate accurate fees, even with multiple-item orders. If you&#39;re concerned at all about the shipping rates of your order, please email us for an exact quote. If possible, we will set up a special flat-rate listing for you. See this help article for more information on how combined shipping rates are calculated http://www.etsy.com/help/article/191 All orders ship via the US postal service. Domestic orders ship either first class (if under 13 ounces) or by Priority Mail. If you need something sent express mail, let us know and we can get a quote. We also will gladly include a gift card and a note with any purchase. Simply leave details in notes to seller during the transaction. Please let us know right away if your order hasn&#39;t arrived in a reasonable time frame - we&#39;ll do our best to help you track it down. INTERNATIONAL We happily ship everywhere! Packages under 4 lbs. ship first class international and packages over that weight must go Priority Mail, which gets a little more expensive. We&#39;re sorry to report that international shipping rates went up quite a bit in January 2013. Again, we&#39;ve done our best to assign exact shipping costs to items and always reimburse shipping fees overpaid by $2 or more. Here&#39;s a two-part strategy for buying things from the U.S.: * Stay under 4 pounds in your package weight, most items have the weight listed on the item page or we can calculate for you OR * Go nuts, way over 4 pounds and fill up a medium flat-rate Priority Mail box, as it will jump up in cost to ship but again, it&#39;s flat rate. * On request, I can ship your order in a flat rate envelope, as long as you are aware that damages can occur, even though there are savings by shipping this way. Any questions, get in touch. Please note that international buyers are responsible for any duties and customs charges that may be incurred. ",
                policy_refunds: "We understand the attention you pay to what&#39;s in your bath and body products - we do, too! To help you choose the best product, we list every ingredient clearly in the item listing except our unique essential oil blends. Essential oils are fully listed on product labels and we&#39;re happy to share them with you upon request. Please let us know if you have concerns or questions about any ingredient. Please let us know right away if you have any concerns at all about your order. We&#39;ll do our very best to resolve the matter promptly. Due to the personal nature of bath and body products, we&#39;re sorry that we cannot exchange items.",
                policy_additional: "All my products come from a smoke free home. I would be happy to work with you on any custom order you may desire. Anything is a possibility ranging from choosing your own color soap, or essential oil combination. Just let me know what I can create for you!",
